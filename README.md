## All OK

There are times all we need the host to say is `200 OK`

If that's what you need, here it is.

You can throw anything at this service and all you get is `OK`.


## How to run

```
docker run -p 8888:80 all-ok
```

or replace `8888` with any port you like.

Then you can start throwing requests at it with all the verbs you have and still get a `200 OK`.


No worries, devs. All is `OK`.

And `200`


`200 OK`


`OK 200`
